### International Cybersecurity Incidents for In-House CTI Analysts‚úåÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è 
Real talk about international cybersecurity incidents for in-house CTI Analysts. Involved in incident support? Yes, No, or Maybe. I‚Äôll share some tips that you might find useful. 
#StandWithUkraine 

- This talk is geared towards: people newer-ish to cybersecurity, Jr. CTI Analysts, people breaking into the industry, & ideas for CTI Managers.

###### `TIP`: KEEP UP WITH INTL. INCIDENT CYBER-RELATED NEWS

### `STEP ONE`:
- Check in with your manager regarding how you can support the incident
  - If you want to get involved, share that with your manager!

### `STEP TWO`: 
**PICK YOUR PATH**
- Involved in Incident at Org - NO
- Involved in Incident at Org - YES

## Involved in Incident at Org - NO
1. Create or find a high fidelity Twitter List [@ddale8 Ukraine List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494327296383021062), [@ch33r10 UA List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1482117927356801024)
2. Look out for any dumps related to the incident, attempt to get them (safely) & search for mention of org/industry vertical/critical third parties
3. Keep up with new developments/changes to the situation (Ex: Log4j multiple CVEs, UA cyber threats)
4. Look for mention of targeting/issues for industry vertical
5. Look for mention of issues/compromises related to known third parties or orgs that it would be reasonable to have an association with
6. Look for technology or similar vulnerability in your org if mentioned/related to incident
7. Practice finding specific procedures/TTPs that can be used by HUNT/SOC/PURPLE/RED
8. Practice pivoting on the IOCs
9. What are different GOV/GOV-related entities saying about it (Ex: CISA, FBI, CERTS, NCSC, etc.)
10. Use the intl incidents to learn what the more reputable sources are
11. Practice your collection strategy and methodology (Keep in mind the [Intelligence Lifecycle](https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-phases/))


###### `TIP`: WATCH EVERYTHING THE SENIOR PERSON DOES DURING THE INCIDENT & TAKE NOTES

## Involved in Incident at Org - YES
`IMPORTANT`: ASK **YOUR MANAGER** BEFORE YOU TRY THIS & GET THEIR APPROVAL. ENSURE RELEVANCY TO YOUR ORG & THAT IT WARRANTS THIS LABOR INTENSIVE PROJECT

### üåûTRACK THE INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT IN A CENTRALIZED LOCATION FOR THE SECURITY TEAM WHERE EVERYONE CAN VIEW IT IN REAL-TIME!üåû

###### `TIP`: USE THE INTELLIGENCE LIFECYCLE AS A REPEATABLE METHODOLOGY TO TRACK THE INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT & PLAN CTI TEAM WORKLOADS - [Intelligence Lifecycle](https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-lifecycle-phases/)

#### `PLANNING & DIRECTION`:

- Manager: Talk with the other team leads at the org for their Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) 
  - Ask what they need for deliverables, support, or other from CTI & their preferred format
  - Ask when & how they want updates 
  - Ask frequency of the updates
    - Ex: Security Leadership needs to know the actor's capabilities, likelihood, vulnerabilities, potential impact, etc. 
    - Ex: DFIR/SOC needs to know the attack path/TTPs and its changes, etc.
    - Ex: Detection Engineering needs detection-related technical context, etc. 
    - Ex: RED needs consolidated red-related info, etc. (Ex: log4j pentester tools on GitHub & procedures to re-create attacks)
    - Ex: HUNT needs actor behavioral information/attack-related information or changes to TTPs, etc. 
    - Ex: CTI needs to curate vetted IOCs, pivot to find additional infrastructure, track associated actors/payloads, create/deploy yararules, extract/research TTPs, intent/opportunity/capability of actor, etc.
-  Obtaining the PIRs prioritizes and buckets collection efforts. 

#### `COLLECTION`:

###### `TIP`: GREAT PUBLIC COLLECTION EXAMPLE YOU CAN REPURPOSE FOR YOUR ORG BASED ON YOUR PIRS (Build a template before you need it) [Curated Intel Ukraine Cyber Operations](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/blob/main/README.md)

- Perform 1-11 above that pertain to PIRs and your collection strategy 
  - *Manager Tip: If you don't have a collection strategy or collection management...this could be something to add to the CTI team roadmap/program goals* 
- Track timeline of events
  - Cyber timeline
    - Cyber-related news reporting
  - Non-Cyber Event timeline (if necessary) 
    - General awareness reporting - especially concerning new developments
      - EX: RU invasion of UA
  - Track actions the org has taken related to the Intl. Incident (SOC, HUNT, CTI, Detection Engineering, RED, Purple, DFIR, etc.)
- Track threat reports released
- Track what GOV/GOV-related entities share about it or advise (Ex: CISA, FBI, CERTS, NCSC, etc.)
- Track new malware variants released 
- Track Actor(s)
  - TTPs
    - Focus on procedures that HUNT/SOC/Purple can use to build detections, perform adversary emulation exercises, or hunt in the environment
  - Document attack paths
  - Track how actors are compromising orgs, including tooling related to the vulnerability or incident
- Track vulnerabilities related to the intl incident
  - Review your organization's posture to the vulnerabilities
- Track software/products related to the incident (Ex: UA-related Kitsoft, Solarwinds, Log4j, etc)
 -  Review your organization's posture to the software/products
- Track any preparation/mitigation/remediation suggestions shared by reputable sources like SANS or others
  - Ex: Mick Douglas' ([@bettersafetynet](https://twitter.com/bettersafetynet)) suggestions for UA-RU Thread [Defending against RU cyber ops](https://twitter.com/bettersafetynet/status/1496496087741480960) 
- Collect any IOCs shared to run through your org's process (vet the IOCs)
- Collect YaraRules shared
- Collect any detection or hunt ideas/opportunities shared
- Track meetings you/your team attended with notes
- Track additional considerations
  - Ex: Belarus helping out RU. 

###### `TIP`: LOOK FOR ORIGINAL SOURCE: EX: LOG4J ISSUE MANAGEMENT - [LINK](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LOG4J2/issues/LOG4J2-3419?filter=allopenissues)

#### `PROCESSING`

- **VERIFY ALL SOURCES**
- Avoid stating something is a fact (If it isn't a fact)
  - Use estimate language, where possible [Estimative Language](https://www.cia.gov/static/0aae8f84700a256abf63f7aad73b0a7d/Words-of-Estimative-Probability.pdf) by Sherman Kent 
- **QUESTION EVERYTHING** ... Especially information shared that you easily *AGREE* with - [Critical Thinking Thread](https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1499156783058857993?s=20&t=cdRszWPtXqi48OQ7JHYy3Q) by [@ErrataRob](https://twitter.com/ErrataRob)
  - Don't believe everything you read (yes, even this)! 
    - Try it out yourself and seek the original context/content, if possible. 
      - Ex: Original technical write up in a news story
- Question: 
  - Data dumps (they can be altered) 
  - Videos/Audio/Images 
    - [SANS Deep Fake Resource](https://www.sans.org/newsletters/ouch/learn-a-new-survival-skill-spotting-deepfakes/) by [@KerryTNews]( https://twitter.com/KerryTNews)

  - Claims  
    - Ex: Warning about people making claims of hacking Satellites in RU - [Link](https://twitter.com/kevincollier/status/1499028981647093762?s=20&t=TzfkuL6RTno5rCNUuJKaDw) by [@kevincollier](https://twitter.com/kevincollier)
  - Information sources
    - Include a rating for the information source's credibility (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`) 
    - Include the information source type (`PRIMARY`, `SECONDARY`, etc.)

#### `ANALYSIS`

- Managers can prioritize/assign PIRs by Analyst skillset and growth opportunities
  - Actor-centric CTI analyst focus on Actor-related analysis/Diamond Model etc.
  - TTP-centric CTI analyst focus on TTP-related PIRs, such as procedures for SOC/DFIR/HUNT/RED/Detection Engineering
  - Red-skilled CTI analyst can help with testing and developing custom signatures
  - Etc...
    - Ex: CTI TEAM ON BEASTMODE - WannaCry: Reverse engineer-skilled CTI Analyst found the killswitch before it was shared publicly
 
#### `DISSEMINATION`

- Ensure the PIR deliverables are simple
  - **REMEMBER: Stay Vigilant - There are other threats than the international cybersecurity incident that you need to "worry" about.** 

#### `FEEDBACK`

- Get feedback from stakeholders during the incident and course correct on the spot
- After the incident: 
  - Check in with other team leaders to see what worked/didn't work
  - Do a "huddle" with the CTI team
    - Use incidents to roadmap skill building & practice areas
